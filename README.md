Real Estate Price Prediction
This repository contains a simple linear regression model built using Python's popular data science libraries - pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The model predicts real estate prices based on the area of the property. The dataset, sourced from 'Book1.csv', consists of two columns - 'area' and 'price'. The Jupyter Notebook in this repository walks through the process of loading the data, visualizing it with a scatter plot, creating a linear regression model, and making predictions.

Instructions:
Installation:

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
The dataset is loaded from 'Book1.csv', and the model is trained to predict prices based on property area.
Usage:

Open the Jupyter Notebook (RealEstatePrediction.ipynb) to explore the step-by-step process.
Modify the code to test predictions with different input values.
Dependencies:

The project relies on pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data handling, numerical operations, machine learning, and data visualization, respectively.
Results:

The model successfully predicts real estate prices based on the provided input values. Example predictions are demonstrated in the notebook.
